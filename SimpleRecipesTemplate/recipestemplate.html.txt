<!--Step one: Download the files or copy and paste them into a notepad app. Remember to name files the title plus either 
    .html or .css for them to be formatted as a specified file type. Ex. "index.html" is the main home page. "beefstew.html" is
    the file name for a recipe. Make a folder to hold them all in. They must be in the same folder to refernce each file.-->
<!-- Step two: Each file can be easily resused as is just by replacing the text in each element.-->
<!-- Step three: Create a new HTML file for a new recipe. Make a new file using the notepad app on pc, save it as the name you
    want it to be as well as adding .html in the save file name. "example.html" -->
<!-- Step four: copy and paste this recipetemplate.html file into your html file. A layout is provided along with explainations
    on how to alter or add to each on as need for your recipe -->
